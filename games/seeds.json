    "rules": "Players can move only diagonally one space except when taking where they can 'jump' opponent pieces any number of times in a row with one piece. The pieces can only move forward unless they have reached the opponents end where they can be 'queened' and then move back and forth. If on your turn you are able to take a piece, then you must take a piece. Winner is whoever doesn't lose all their pieces."
